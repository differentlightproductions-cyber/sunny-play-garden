// Age and difficulty. Every player has either an exact age (2 to 7) or an age group, chosen by a grown-up (at setup, or later in
// Grown-ups > Age and difficulty). Each game asks `SPG.level.tier('rain')` and gets 1 (easiest), 2 (the original game) or 3 (older kids).
//  - An age group is a predefined plan: every game uses that group's tier.
//  - An exact age is a curated mix: each game steps up at its own age (RULE), so a 5-year-old might play the maths at tier 3 and
//    the Fruit Splash balloons still at tier 2.
// Saved on the player as `level`: { mode: 'group', group: 'tiny' | 'little' | 'big' } or { mode: 'age', age: 2..7 }.
// A player with no choice (or an old save) is "Little kid", which is exactly how the games always played.
